## Godot Input Test Suite

Simple input testing application used for internal / personal purposes. 

### Using in your project as an overlay or UI

Since all logic and rendering is handled via built-in scripts, adding these
scenes to any project should allow you to use this overlay in any godot project
compatible with Godot 4.X

## TODO

- [ ] Proper validation == test that all conditions have been passed and play a sound effect w/ and OK sound. Perhaps change color of button outline to reflect their completion.
- [ ] PS4 touchpad, gyroscope (for switch or ps4), and more hardware specific exceptions.
